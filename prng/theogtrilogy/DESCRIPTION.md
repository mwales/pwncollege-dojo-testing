Well, that was embarassing. The challenge has been fixed now.

Now as soon as you start the game the PRNG gets seeded with the number
of seconds that have passed since Jan 1, 1970 (epoch).  So now everytime you
start the game you will get a different seed to start the game. Good luck
defeating that!  Ha Ha Ha

To get the flag for this challenge, you need to predict the winner of my Star
Wars battle game 7 times in a row!
